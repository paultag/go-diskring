// Package diskring contains an implementation of a ring buffer, backed by
// a file on the filesystem. This allows concurrent reads and writes by
// goroutines, overwriting data as needed, oldest-first.
//
// This buffer does not have fixed sizes, rather, it enocdes the length with
// the written data. Data is added and removed at the chunk level.
